Puppet WebHooks
====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/puppetlabs/puppet-webhooks.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/puppetlabs/puppet-webhooks)

This project performs a job or jobs when a pull request event occurs on
[Github](https://github.com/).  Current implemented behaviors are:

 * [✓] Create a Trello Card when a Pull Request is created or synchronized.
 * [✓] Avoid duplicate cards being created when a pull request is synchronized or closed.
 * [✓] Check the `X-Hub-Signature` created by the [web service hook][web-service-hook].
 * [✓] Queue work and perform jobs asynchronously.
 * [✓] Auto-scale the number of workers to zero when there are no jobs to perform.
 * [✓] Auto-scale the number of workers to one when there are jobs to perform.
 * [✓] Near real-time behavior, no polling intervals involved.
 * [✓] Near real-time behavior, no polling intervals involved.
 * [✓] Archive a Trello Card when a Pull Request is closed.
 * [✓] Check multiple boards for the existence of a card if `TRELLO_BOARDS`
   contains a comma separated list of board ID's.
 * [✓] Set the card due date to 2 PM next business day when a card is created
   if `TRELLO_SET_TARGET_RESPONSE_TIME=true`.
 * [ ] Copy a comment to the card when a comment is added to the pull request.

Quick Start
====

First, review the [Heroku Quickstart][quickstart] guide. Create an account and
install the Toolbelt. To use this code on Heroku you'll need to verify your
account by adding a valid credit card, even if you use the free facilities.
Without this verification you will receive an error within Heroku when
receiving notifications.  The code may be run without a credit card using
`RACK_ENV=development foreman start` with a local PostgreSQL server.

The rest of this section is concerned with deploying the application to Heroku.

Next, we simply need to create a copy of this application.  run `heroku create`
which will add a git remote named `heroku` to the git repository.  Deployments
will happen with a simple `git push heroku`.

Here's what the first step, `heroku create` looks like.  An application name
and URL will automatically be chosen for you.  The application name may be
changed in the [Heroku Dashboard][dashboard].

    $ heroku create
    Creating fierce-meadow-9708... done, stack is cedar
    http://fierce-meadow-9708.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:fierce-meadow-9708.git
    Git remote heroku added

Next, push the application to [Heroku][heroku] with `git push heroku HEAD:master`.

    $ git push heroku HEAD:master

Configuration Options
----

The application is up and running at this point, but the following
configuration options may be useful.  All of the configuration of this
application is done using environment variables set through the `heroku
config:add` action.

Due Dates and Timezones
----

Add a due date for newly created cards if you have a target response time for
pull requests you'd like to track.  At Puppet Labs we use this as a clear way
to stay on top of incoming pull requests.  If this variable is `"true"` then
the application will set the due date of a newly created cards to 2 PM of the
next business day.  Please note this behavior depends on the timezone.

    $ heroku config:set TRELLO_SET_TARGET_RESPONSE_TIME=true
    $ heroku config:set TZ=America/Los_Angeles

A list of timezone strings may be found at [List of tz database time
zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)

Multiple Boards
----

Often times a card will move from one board to another board if there are
multiple teams working together.  If a card is not located on the board
containing the target list for newly created cards, then the application will
not find the already created card by default.  The app may be configured to
search for a card on additional boards if the card is not found on the board
containing the target list.  To do so, set the `TRELLO_BOARDS` variable to a
comma separated list of board identifiers.  (Note, the board ID may be copied
directly from the Trello URL)

    $ heroku config:set TRELLO_BOARDS=4fd8ed1769c9e77f1e0d6882,50bd46a84c27cb74100035f5

Database Migration
----

Once the application is pushed, the database schema needs to be created.  This
is accomplished using a migration rake task:

    $ heroku run bundle exec rake db:migrate
    Running `bundle exec rake db:migrate` attached to terminal... up, run.9637
       (1209.8ms)  CREATE TABLE "schema_migrations" ("version" character varying(255) NOT NULL)
       (28.7ms)  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "unique_schema_migrations" ON "schema_migrations" ("version")
       (0.8ms)  SELECT "schema_migrations"."version" FROM "schema_migrations"
    Migrating to CreateDelayedJobs (1)
       (0.9ms)  BEGIN
    ==  CreateDelayedJobs: migrating ==============================================
    -- create_table(:delayed_jobs, {:force=>true})
    NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE will create implicit sequence "delayed_jobs_id_seq" for serial column "delayed_jobs.id"
    NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index "delayed_jobs_pkey" for table "delayed_jobs"
       (168.8ms)  CREATE TABLE "delayed_jobs" ("id" serial primary key, "priority" integer DEFAULT 0, "attempts" integer DEFAULT 0, "handler" text, "last_error" text, "run_at" timestamp, "locked_at" timestamp, "failed_at" timestamp, "locked_by" character varying(255), "queue" character varying(255), "created_at" timestamp NOT NULL, "updated_at" timestamp NOT NULL)
       -> 0.1997s
    -- add_index(:delayed_jobs, [:priority, :run_at], {:name=>"delayed_jobs_priority"})
       (5.3ms)  CREATE INDEX "delayed_jobs_priority" ON "delayed_jobs" ("priority", "run_at")
       -> 0.0075s
    ==  CreateDelayedJobs: migrated (0.2074s) =====================================
       (1.0ms)  INSERT INTO "schema_migrations" ("version") VALUES ('1')
       (4.8ms)  COMMIT

Finally, set the configuration variables that contain the Trello API keys and
Github shared secret.  First, the shared secret so we can authenticate Github
requests:

Github Shared Secret
----

In order to provide some authentication of the request a secret key may be
configured in GitHub and in Heroku.  This shared secret key may then be used to
validate a digital signature of the body of the request in the
`X-Hub-Signature` header.  Validating the signature should just be a matter of
comparing the value of the header with the computed value.

See [web service hook][web-service-hook] for more information.  To configure
the secret, make sure the `secret` key in the `config` hash posted to
`https://api.github.com/repos/<account>/<repository>/hooks` matches the
`GITHUB_X_HUB_SIGNATURE_SECRET` configuration setting in Heroku.

To set these from the shell:

    url="https://fierce-meadow-9708.herokuapp.com/event/github"
    secret="$(dd if=/dev/random bs=1k count=1 | openssl sha256 | awk '{print $2}')"

Then configure this hook URL and shared secret on Github:

    curl -i -u jeffmccune -d '
    {
      "name": "web",
      "active": true,
      "events": ["pull_request", "issues"],
      "config": {
        "url": "'"${url}"'",
        "secret": "'"${secret}"'",
        "content_type": "json"
      }
    }' https://api.github.com/repos/puppetlabs/puppet/hooks

And finally the setting in heroku:

    heroku config:set GITHUB_X_HUB_SIGNATURE_SECRET="$secret"

Trello OAuth Tokens
----

Four configuration settings determine how to authenticate against Trello and
where to place cards.  These four settings are:

    TRELLO_APP_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    TRELLO_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    TRELLO_USER_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    TRELLO_TARGET_LIST_ID=50bd46a84c27cb74100036be

These are settable using the heroku command line interface:

    heroku config:add  \
      TRELLO_APP_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
      TRELLO_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
      TRELLO_USER_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
      TRELLO_TARGET_LIST_ID=50bd46a84c27cb74100036be

The Trello app key and secret can be retrieved from
[https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate](https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate).

The Trello user token can be generated with various expiration dates and
permissions via instructions at
[https://trello.com/docs/gettingstarted/index.html#getting-a-token-from-a-user](https://trello.com/docs/gettingstarted/index.html#getting-a-token-from-a-user)

The Trello list ID where the cards should be created.  To find this value,
navigate to the Trello board that you are interested in in your browser and
copy the board id from the URL.

Then run:

    $ curl https://api.trello.com/1/board/<board_id>/lists?key=<app_key>&token=<user_token>
    [{"id":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","name":"Pull Requests","closed":false,"idBoard":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","pos":8192,"subscribed":false}]

And copy the id for the list where you want new cards to be created.

Delayed Job
----

Talking to the various API endpoints are a bit more time consuming than the
500ms web dyno recommended response time.  To make sure the web dyno is nice
and responsive, delayed job worker dynos are used to perform the heavy lifting.

Delayed job requires an SQL database.  Most of the documentation assumes Rails,
but we're taking the Sinatra only approach.  Heroku should automatically detect
the 'pg' gem is in use and will should have provisioned a database
automatically.  If not, please add the database using the following
information.

Workless
----

To use [workless][workless] the Heroku API key is required.  This is obtainable
using the following commands.  (TODO Make this a rake task).  The API key is
the password field of `~/.netrc` for the host api.heroku.com.

    heroku config:add \
      HEROKU_API_KEY=$HEROKU_API_KEY \
      APP_NAME=fierce-meadow-9708

PostgreSQL Database
----

To configure an SQL database: (More detailed information at [heroku
postgresql][heroku-postgresql].)

    heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev
    Adding heroku-postgresql:dev on fierce-meadow-9708... done, v23 (free)
    Attached as HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_GREEN_URL
    Database has been created and is available
     ! This database is empty. If upgrading, you can transfer
     ! data from another database with pgbackups:restore.
    Use `heroku addons:docs heroku-postgresql:dev` to view documentation.

Then promote this database to be the provisioned database.  You may need to
replace `GREEN` with the color assigned by Heroku shown in the output of the
above command.

    heroku pg:promote HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_GREEN_URL
    Promoting HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_GREEN_URL to DATABASE_URL... done

If developing locally, the database configuration should be stored in
`config/database.yml`.  Heroku will automatically replace this file according
to [Ruby Support Build behavior][BuildBehavior].  (Note, in Heroku the
database.yml file needs to be fed through ERB.  It is not valid YAML if read
directly.)

GitHub Setup
----

The WebHook URL's in a repository's admin interface only fire with branches are
pushed.  The API must be used to trigger generic WebHooks for other events.

See:

 * [Repo Hooks API](http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/)
 * [Add a github repo webhook for pull
   requests](https://gist.github.com/2726012)
 * [github-services
   web.rb](https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/services/web.rb)
 * [github OAuth token for command line
   use](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-oauth-token-for-command-line-use)
   (Our app will use this token to interact with github)
 * [github scopes](http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes)

Check the current hooks:

    curl -i -u jeffmccune https://api.github.com/repos/jeffmccune/puppet-webhooks/hooks

Listing Jobs
----

If you're curious to see how jobs are getting queued, start up a server
locally, then submit some fake pull requests using the rake tasks:

    $ rake api:run
    foreman start
    18:19:13 web.1  | started with pid 60414

Then, in another terminal, submit a fake pull request webhook just as Github
will:

    $ rake api:pull_request
    curl -i --data "payload=$(cat spec/unit/fixtures/example_pull_request.json)" http://localhost:5000/event/pull_request
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 0
    Connection: keep-alive
    Server: thin 1.5.0 codename Knife

You should now see this job in your PostgreSQL database:

    jeff=# \c "puppet_webhooks_dev"
    You are now connected to database "puppet_webhooks_dev" as user "jeff".
    puppet_webhooks_dev=# select id,last_error,run_at,queue from delayed_jobs;
     id | last_error |           run_at           |    queue
    ----+------------+----------------------------+--------------
      6 |            | 2012-12-30 18:22:10.964711 | pull_request
    (1 row)

This job will be cleared when you run `rake jobs:work`.

Authentication
----

Incoming requests may be authentication against Github and Travis.  Travis uses
the pattern `#{username}/#{repository}#{TRAVIS_AUTH_TOKEN}`.

Configuring Github requires the same configuration as the deployment.  This is
currently `gepetto-bot`.

Get the specific URL of the travis hook by listing all of the hooks:

    $ curl -i -u "jeffmccune:$PASSWORD" \
    https://api.github.com/repos/jeffmccune/puppet-webhooks/hooks | tee hooks.json

With the specific hook URL:

    $ curl -i -u "jeffmccune:$PASSWORD" -d '
    {  "config": {
         "token": "'"$TRAVIS_AUTH_TOKEN"'",
         "user": "gepetto-bot",
         "domain": ""
      }
    }' https://api.github.com/repos/jeffmccune/puppet-webhooks/hooks/633908

Examples
====

The spec tests are configured to use an in-memory sqlite3 database with
ActiveRecord and DelayedJob.  The rake tasks, spec helper, and application
itself should use the `PuppetLabs::Webhook.setup_environment` method to setup
the database connection.

To run the specs:

    $ bundle exec rake spec RACK_ENV=test

Interactive Exploration
====

This code base is designed to be relatively straight forward to work with
interactively using tools like `irb` and `pry`.  Here's how I quickly rig up
instances of the jobs that are performed by this web app.  First, make sure you
have an example of the JSON data stored in the fixtures directory.  For this
example I'm going to use `spec/unit/fixtures/example_pull_request_closed.json`.

Next, add something like the following two methods to `~/.irbrc`.  The goal is
to quickly get a reference to an instance of the job that will be performed.

```ruby
##
# jjm_load_path sets up the load path to include both the spec/ and lib/
# directories.  This method makes the assumption that the present working
# directory is the base directory of the project
def jjm_load_path
  spec = File.expand_path("spec")
  $LOAD_PATH.delete spec
  $LOAD_PATH.unshift spec
  path = File.expand_path("lib")
  $LOAD_PATH.delete path
  $LOAD_PATH.unshift path
  $LOAD_PATH[0..1]
end

##
# jjm_prjob creates an instance of TrelloPullRequestJob suitable for
# interactive testing.
def jjm_prjob(fixture = "example_pull_request_closed.json")
  jjm_load_path
  require 'puppet_labs/pull_request_controller'
  require 'spec_helper'
  payload = read_fixture(fixture)
  pull_request = PuppetLabs::PullRequest.new(:json => payload)
  job = PuppetLabs::TrelloPullRequestJob.new
  job.pull_request = pull_request
  job
end
```

Next, make sure your environment variables are configured and exported.  In
order to interact with Trello, you'll need the following environment variables.
If you already have a copy of this app running in Heroku it's super easy to get
these variables set using `heroku config --shell | grep TRELLO | xargs -n1 echo
export > trello_env.sh`, then simply `eval "$(trello_env.sh)"`.

    TRELLO_APP_KEY
    TRELLO_SECRET
    TRELLO_TARGET_LIST_ID
    TRELLO_USER_TOKEN

Finally, make sure you're current working directory is in the root of the
application repository and you should be ready to go.

    $ bundle exec irb
    Welcome to IRB. You are using ruby 1.9.3p327 (2012-11-10) [x86_64-darwin12.2.0]. Have fun ;)
    >> job = jjm_prjob; nil #=> nil
    >> job.perform #=> true
    Processing: (PR puppet-webhooks/2) Test Pull Request 1
    Done Processing: (PR puppet-webhooks/2) Test Pull Request 1
    >>

And you should see the results right on the board.

![Trello Activity](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/469429/pics/trello_activity.png)

Stick a `require 'pry'; binding.pry` statement inside of the `perform` method
and you can dive right into the method itself.
